# Algorithms I implemented in this project were: 
* Depth-First Search
* Breadth-First Search
* Uniform Cost Search
* A* Search
* Value Iteration (markov decision process)
* Q-learning (markov decision process)
* Particle Filtering (bayesian Inference)
* Neural Network
# How to run
1. Open a project
2. go to its PDF file
3. choose a question then type the command in the command prompt using python env to test the implementation
